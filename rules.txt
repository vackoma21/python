Dictionary:
Hit = to ask for another card
Stand = to not taky any more cards
Bet = money you place on your win
Dealer = a person that deals the cards, also plays
Ace = card with value either 1 or 11
Blackjack/natural = total of 2 cards is equal to 21
Bust = exceeding the value 21
Double down = double the value of your bet, only after the first 2 cards
Push = the dealer and the player have the same total
Upcard = the dealer's card that's face up

Before the game starts, place your bet

At the start everyone gets 2 cards from the deck
One by one the players choose to STAND or HIT
STAND means to not take another card
HIT means to draw another card to get closer to the 21 value point
When you draw ace, it counts as 11 unless your deck exceeds 21, then it is 1
